NOTE : Uncomment the code which you want to run! 
1) I have implemented stack & queue using Linkedlist, vector, vector+template(Generalized) in CPP 


RUNNING:-
       => g++ stack.cpp/g++ queue.cpp
       =>./a.out

2) Binary Tree => Traversals, height, kth level, printing all levels level-wise, Count of nodes, sum of all nodes, replacing sum, Diameter of tree etc etc are implemented

RUNNING:-
        => g++ tree.cpp
        => ./a.out
        
3) Binary Search Tree, running similarly as above
